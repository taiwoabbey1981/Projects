== Getting Started - Cloud Foundry

This section covers how to get started with Spring Cloud Data Flow on Cloud Foundry. See the https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/installation/cloudfoundry/[Cloud Foundry] section of the microsite for more information on installing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Cloud Foundry.

Once you have the Data Flow server installed on Cloud Foundry, you probably want to get started with orchestrating the deployment of readily available pre-built applications into coherent streaming or batch data pipelines. We have guides to help you get started with both link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/stream-developer-guides/[Stream] and link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/batch-developer-guides/[Batch] processing.
