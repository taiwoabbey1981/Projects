If you are getting started with Spring Cloud Data Flow, this section is for you.
In this section, we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions.
You can find a gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Data Flow along with installation instructions.
We then build an introductory Spring Cloud Data Flow application, discussing some core principles as we go.

This section covers how to get started with Spring Cloud Data Flow running locally on Docker Compose. See the link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/installation/local/[Local Machine] section of the microsite for more information on installing Spring Cloud Data Flow on Docker Compose.

Once you have the Data Flow server installed locally, you probably want to get started with orchestrating the deployment of readily available pre-built applications into coherent streaming or batch data pipelines. We have guides to help you get started with both link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/stream-developer-guides/[Stream] and link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/batch-developer-guides/[Batch] processing.
