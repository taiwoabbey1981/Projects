== Spring Cloud Data Flow Server Core

The `spring-cloud-dataflow-server-core` subproject of `spring-cloud-dataflow` provides a common
REST API and UI that can be used to create a Data Flow Server for a particular deployment
environment when combined with an implementation of the `spring-cloud-deployer` SPI for that
environment.

The REST API includes a `StreamDefinitionController` and `TaskDefinitionController` that manage
stream and task definitions by delegating to the `StreamDefinitionRepository` and
`TaskDefinitionRepository`, respectively. The `StreamDeploymentController` and
`TaskDeploymentController` delegate to the `AppDeployer` and `TaskLauncher` provided by the
underlying `spring-cloud-deployer` SPI implementation. Other controllers provide endpoints for
managing the `AppRegistry`, viewing counters, etc.

The `spring-cloud-dataflow-server` project uses this dependency and pulls in task platform deployers for CloudFoundry and Kubernetes.
