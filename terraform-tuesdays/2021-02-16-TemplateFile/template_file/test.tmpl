# We are going to try and make use of a string, list, and map
Here's the string value you passed: ${mystring}

%{ for i in split(",",mylist) ~}
Here's a value: ${i}
%{ endfor }

Now let's try to reconstruct a map
%{ for k, v in zipmap(split(",",mapkeys),split(",",mapvalues)) ~}
My key ${k} is value ${v}
%{ endfor }

What about a set?
%{ for s in split(",",myset) ~}
Set element: ${s}
%{ endfor }
