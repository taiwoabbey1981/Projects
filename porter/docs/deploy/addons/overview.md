For deployments that do not fall into the three application types (i.e. web service, worker, and cron job), you can deploy them as add-ons on Porter. Below is the list of add-ons that are currently supported. 

If you have requests for add-ons you'd like us to support, please let us know in the #suggestions channel of our [community](https://discord.gg/mmGAw5nNjr).

- [Redis](doc:redis)
