Porter supports setting basic authorization permissions via for other members in a Porter project. At the moment, there are 3 roles that can be assigned in a Porter project:

- **Admin:** read/write access to all resources, ability to delete the project and manage team members.
- **Developer:** read/write access to applications, jobs, environment groups, cluster data, and integrations.
- **Viewer:** read access to applications, jobs, environment groups, and cluster data.

# Adding Collaborators

To add a new collaborator to a Porter project, you must be logged in with an **Admin** role. As an admin, you will see a **Settings** tab in the sidebar. Navigate to **Settings** and input the email of the user you would like to add. This will generate an invitation link for the user, which expires in 24 hours. The user will get an email to join the Porter project, but if the email is not delivered, you can copy the invite link and send it to them directly.
