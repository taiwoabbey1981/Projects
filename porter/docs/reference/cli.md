# Connecting to an existing cluster
### `porter connect kubeconfig`
Connects Porter to an existing Kubernetes cluster using the `current-context` in your `kubeconfig`.

# Pushing Docker images to your Porter image registry

> ðŸš§ You must be logged in before configuring registry access
> 
> Please make sure you are logged in by running `porter config set-host https://dashboard.getporter.dev; porter auth login` first.

### `porter docker configure`

Writes to the local Docker `config.json` file to grant push/pull access to the image registries provisioned by Porter. Once you have run this command, you can directly use the `docker` CLI to push to the private image registry.

**Example:**

```sh
porter docker configure
docker build . -t gcr.io/project-123456/porter-server:latest
docker push gcr.io/project-123456/porter-server:latest
```

> ðŸ“˜
>
> We are working to add support for additional private Docker registries. If you don't see your registry provider, send us an email at [contact@getporter.dev](mailto:contact@getporter.dev) or feel free to contribute to the [repo](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter).

# Connecting the CLI to a locally running instance of Porter

### `porter config set-host [HOST]`

Sets the URL of the Porter API server the CLI will communicate with. HOST is a URL including the protocol and defaults to `https://dashboard.getporter.dev`. 

For locally running porter instances, run:

```sh
porter config set-host http://localhost:8080
```

# Remote Execution
### `porter run [RELEASE] -- [COMMAND] [args...]`

> ðŸš§ Prequisites
> 
> **Note:** before running this command, you should make sure your cluster is set in your config. Run `porter clusters list` to view the list of connected clusters, and run `porter config set-cluster [ID]` to set the correct cluster in your config.

Allows users to execute a command on a remote container. The `release` variable is the name of the release on the Porter dashboard (this can be a release either in the "Applications" or the "Jobs" tab). For example, if I have a release called `web`, and I would like to enter an interactive shell in the container attached to `web`, I would run:

```sh
porter run web -- sh
```
 
To test that remote execution is working, you can run:

```sh
porter run web -- echo "hello world"
```

To run in a namespace other than `default`, use the `--namespace` flag:

```sh
porter run web --namespace other-namespace -- sh
```
