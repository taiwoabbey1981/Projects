# MongoDB Charts Repo

To use these charts the MongoDB Helm repository needs to be added with:

```shell
helm repo add mongodb https://mongodb.github.io/helm-charts
```

There are many Helm charts in this repository, please read each Chart's README
file for instructions on how to install each particular Helm Chart and its
capabilities.

Currently, only the [Atlas Operator Helm Chart](./atlas-operator) should be
installed from this repository and it is considered a _Trial_.
